# Oral assessment with supervisors

Each student will have to attend 2 individual oral assessment with their supervisors:

  1. half-way through the project
  2. at the end


This is done to ensure that all members of the teams work equally, to evaluaten performance of each student, and that of the group.

```admonish info
This meeting will be planned by the supervisors, and there is nothing specific to prepare.

In order to pass the course, students have to:

1. attend and take part in the group\'s midterm presentation and final presentation,
2. show a sufficient level of cooperation and communication with students, tutors and geo-information professionals (see appendix 3),
3. submit a sufficient reflection on the quality of the (midterm) project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project, obtain a pass for their individual project strategy proposal (see appendix 3), and
4. show to have performed a sufficient amount of tasks (either
    quantitative or qualitative) in the project (see appendix 4).

If a student fails, then the student has to take the course in another
academic year again.

### Rubric for report report

|  | Insufficient  | Fair  | Excellent |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Introducing the idea/Problem statement** | Neither implicit nor explicit reference is made to the topic or purpose of the report.                      | Readers are aware of the overall problem, challenge, or topic of the report.                           | The topic is introduced very well, and groundwork is laid as to the direction of the report.            |
| **Structure**                | The report appears to have no direction, with subtopics appearing disjointed.                               | There is a basic flow from one section to the next, but not all sections or paragraphs follow in a natural or logical order. | The report goes from general ideas to specific conclusions. Transitions tie sections together, as well as adjacent paragraphs. |
| **Coverage**                 | Major sections of pertinent content have been omitted or greatly run-on. The topic is of little significance to the project. | All major sections of the pertinent content are included, but not covered in as much depth, or as explicit, as expected. | The appropriate content in consideration is covered in depth without being redundant. Sources are cited when specific statements are made. Significance to the project is unquestionable. |
| **Writing**                  | It is hard to know what the writer is trying to express. Writing is convoluted. Misspelled words, incorrect grammar, and improper punctuation are evident. | Writing is generally clear, but unnecessary words are occasionally used. Meaning is sometimes hidden. Paragraph or sentence structure is too repetitive. Few spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors are made. | Writing is crisp, clear, and succinct. The writer incorporates the active voice when appropriate and supports ideas with examples. Almost no spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors are made. |
| **Conclusion and reflection**| There is no indication the author tried to synthesize the information or make a critical reflection based on the literature under review. No reflection on the use and suitability for the research project is given. | The author provides concluding remarks that show an analysis and synthesis of ideas occurred. Some of the conclusions, however, were not supported in the body of the report. Reflection on the use for the research project is limited. | The author was able to make succinct and precise conclusions based on the review. A clear reflection on the applicability for the research project is given. Insights into the problem are appropriate. |
| **Citations/References**     | Citation for the report did not follow a well-known format and was missing essential information.            | Citation for the report did follow a well-known format however; a few errors in essential information were evident. | Citation for the report did follow a well-known format.
