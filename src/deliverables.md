<!-- TODO: shouldn't this be deleted and just the interview?! -->
<!-- ## 9. Reflection on the project including the final report 

The reflection is an individual task (max. 1,000 words). In the
reflection you highlight and explain the strengths and weaknesses of the
research presented (e.g., sound strategy, innovative methodology,
limited data quality, etc). In the reflection you also should indicate
your personal lessons learned: what did you learn in the Synthesis
project (e.g., to apply Geomatics theory in practice, manage a project,
learned to lead a group, others have also great ideas, etc.) and what
would you personally do differently if you had to do the same synthesis
project again (e.g., more in the lead, start earlier to meet
supervisors, more/less pro-active, etc). **Guiding questions** for the
reflection are:

1. What did you learn by doing this assignment?
1. Which parts of the report are you proud of?
1. Which parts of the report should be improved?
1. What went well in the cooperation in the team?
1. What can be improved in the cooperation in the team?
1. What will you personally do differently next time? -->
