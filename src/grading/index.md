# Grading

In order to pass the course, students have to:

1. attend and take part in the group\'s midterm presentation and final presentation,
2. show a sufficient level of cooperation and communication with students, tutors and geo-information professionals (see appendix 3),
3. submit a sufficient reflection on the quality of the (midterm) project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project, obtain a pass for their individual project strategy proposal (see appendix 3), and
4. show to have performed a sufficient amount of tasks (either
    quantitative or qualitative) in the project (see appendix 4).

If a student fails, then the student has to take the course in another
academic year again.


## Oral assessment with supervisors

Each student will have to attend 2 individual oral assessment with their supervisors:

  1. half-way through the project
  2. at the end


This is done to ensure that all members of the teams work equally, to evaluaten performance of each student, and that of the group.

```admonish info
This meeting will be planned by the supervisors, and there is nothing specific to prepare.
