|  | No reflection | Weak | Sufficient | Good | Excellent |
|--|---------------|------|------------|------|-----------|
| **Reflection on the process**: cooperation in the team/planning  | Discussion only touches trivial or very general points of criticism.  | Student only identifies some possible weaknesses/strengths in the process which are in reality irrelevant or non-existent.     | Student indicates most weaknesses/strengths in the process. | Student indicates most weaknesses/strengths in the process. Alternatives are provided.                                                                                 | Student indicates all weaknesses/strengths in the process, and is also able to indicate which weaknesses/strengths affect the outcome most and how to address these in a next report. |
| **Reflection on the technical quality of the work**    | Discussion only touches trivial or very general points of criticism.  | Student only identifies some possible weaknesses/strengths in results which are in reality irrelevant or non-existent.          | Student indicates most weaknesses/strengths in the results, but does not weigh their impact on the main results relative to each other. | Student indicates most weaknesses/strengths in the results and process, and is able to prioritize them relative to each other.                            | Student indicates all weaknesses/strengths in the results and is also able to indicate which affect the outcome of the research most.                                            |
