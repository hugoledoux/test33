# Project Initiation Document (PID)

The launch of a project should be described in a report. This, so-called Project Initiation Document (PID), is common for complex projects. The exact content of the Project Initiation Document should be discussed with your case supervisor(s) of the TU Delft. As a guideline you may think about the following components:

- Description and aim of the project: what problem will you solve and/or what will you be doing?
- Description of the approach or methodology that you'll follow
- Responsibilities of each team member to the project (e.g., data collection, software development, project management, data analysis, reporting)
- List of needs (e.g., sensors, equipment, data, software, hardware) and a proposal who should provide the needs
- Contribution and responsibilities of the client: what do you expect of them?
- Inventory of the risks, i.e., events and internal and external constraints which may cause a (partly) failing of the project 
- Planning of activities and deliverables (e.g., a Gantt chart)
- Communication plan (project meetings, distribution list of minutes of meetings, consultation moments with client)
- Short CVs of team members (so that the client knows who you are)
