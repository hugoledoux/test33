# Oral assessment with supervisors

Each student will have to attend 2 individual oral assessment with their supervisors:

  1. half-way through the project
  2. at the end


This is done to ensure that all members of the teams work equally, to evaluaten performance of each student, and that of the group.

```admonish info
This meeting will be planned by the supervisors, and there is nothing specific to prepare.
```
