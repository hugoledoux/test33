<!-- toc -->

## 1. Midterm report

The midterm report should provide the skeleton of the final report: a preliminary table of content of the final report with, for each section, a text drafted or a text indicating the intended content of that particular section.

A template for the report will be provided to obtain uniformity in the structure of all synthesis reports.
<!-- TODO: where is this template actually?-->

```admonish info
The midterm report should be submitted through the appropriate section in Brightspace.
```


## 2. Midterm presentation

Each project team gives a midterm presentation including:

- project at hand summarised
- status and progress of the project: preliminary results
- amendments to the Project Initiation Document, including motivation
    of these amendments, consequences, etc. (if necessary)

Also include your presentation the process/management of the project:

- how your project is organised (who is responsible for what, time
    management, communication, how is the supervision organised, risk
    management/ mitigation)
- involvement of the company
- what runs well, what needs to be improved
- planning until the final report deadline

The presentation is maximum 15 minutes, followed by a 10minute discussion.
The audience consists of all GEO1101 students, the supervisors, and possibly the client.

**Submission:** your midterm presentation should be submitted through
the appropriate section in Brightspace.
<!-- TODO: why submit the pres actually? -->

**Recommendation:** Prepare at this stage a written summary of the
results of your project. This helps you to conduct your oral
presentation and eases the completion of the final report.


## 3. Midterm team peer-review

Your team has to review another's team midterm report. The outcome of
the review is shared with supervisors and students.

During the midterm presentations, your team is also tasked to ask at
least two questions to the team whose work you reviewed.

**Submission:** your midterm team peer-review report should be
submitted through the appropriate section in Brightspace.
