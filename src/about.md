## Expected prior knowledge 
Geomatics students should have gained 30 EC of core geomatics courses (Core courses are: GEO1000, GEO1001, GEO1002, GEO1003, GEO1004, GEO1006, GEO1007, GEO1009, GEO1015, and GEO1016). External students are admitted if they have similar knowledge and skills based on a certified course list.

## Course Contents
The project aims at investigating a real-world geo-information problem. Geomatics teachers in cooperation with a company, governmental agency, or a TU Delft research group that is not involved in the Geomatics program the clients define the problem. The problem will be addressed by a group of students. The project enables you to gain further knowledge and skills in acquisition, processing, analysis and interpretation, and visualization of geo-information as well as insights in the running of a project in which diverse stakeholders are involved.

## Study Goals

After this course students are able to:

* understand, through a project at hand, how each of the individual parts of the geo-information process (from measurement (geo-data gathering), geo-data processing and analysis, to presentation, delivery and application) relate to each other and to the chain as a whole.
* apply and expand the knowledge and competences acquired during the core Geomatics courses by developing a solution to a real world geo-information problem.
* apply the basic components of a project management strategy to a project addressing a real world geo-information problem.
* cooperate and communicate with students, tutors and geo-information professionals. In the cooperation, the student shows commitment, perseverance, responsibility, sense of perspective and leadership.
* critically reflect on the quality of the project result(s), on the feasibility to implement the project result(s) in practice, and on their own performance in the project.
* present the work performed in a structured way through an oral presentation to their peers and the wider geo-information community.


**Assessment**:
<!-- TODO: +0.5 but oral assessment if we see people do nothing? -->
Your final grade is compiled from a group grade for the project final report. The group grade is based on the technical quality of the project, and the performance of the student in the research process.

The individual reflection on the final report can influence positively or negatively for 0.5 grade point (maximum) the grade on the final report. The grading is detailed in the rubrics available on Brightspace.

In order to pass the course, students also have to attend and take part in the group's midterm presentation, and two final presentations (one technical presentation for Geomatics staff/students and one outreach presentation on Geomatics Day), and do the team peer review (on both the midterm report and final technical presentation).

To pass the course, a group mark and an individual mark of at least a 5.75 is required. Students that fail the course have to do a repair assignment for a maximum grade of a 6.0 for the course.

**Enrolment / Application**: BIS: only for Geomatics students (and Approved International 'Study Abroad' Students).


**Course evaluation**: For the course evaluations, see the Brightspace page 'Evaluations TUD' (requires enrolment).
